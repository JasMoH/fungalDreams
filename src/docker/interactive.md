# example shell for interactive development

This is a variation of a script I have migrated as a snippet between a few different projects. I find it
useful for debugging containers, as well as carrying around a clean development environment.

It is possible to use this to completely encapsulate your development environment, which can be especially
useful for complicated C/C++ toolchains.

```shell
{{#include run_interactive_env.sh}}
```
