# what is this mess?

This is a place to put my thoughts and musings on software development, embedded deelopment, and the like.
common lessons, resources for learning things, snipets, etc. You can see the source for all of this
[at my github page for it](https://github.com/JasMoH/fungalDreams)

I find that periodically want to collect tutorials, learning resources, tools, and other usefule things
all in one place for myself or as a resource for team-members and friends.
