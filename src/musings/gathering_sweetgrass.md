# some thoughts on gathering sweetgrass

look at the joy you get from any given minute of a coopertom video vs all the joyless garbage from meta.


# the gift of strawberries and ideas
the strawberries belong to themselves. this is how mathemeticians talk about math, and how the makerspaces
I grew up in talk about open source things. information wants to be free, it doesn't belong to somebody.
open source is a gift that you cannot earn or even deserve, and you honor it by using it for your own ends.

# animacy of machines
the parts of my car are being a car - they could be something else and someday they will.
metal ca be melted down and recycled, or the engine can be converted to a generator.
ultimately tools are made by people to *do* something. they are the physical embodiement of social interactions.
weapons are tools built to kill, toys are tools built to entertain, medical devices are tools built to heal.
they are the embodiement of those actions, and are themselves *verbs*

it's hard not to see this paralleling the way that america broadly sees things as disposable. if the language
binds something to only ever be what it is now, it requires great effort to transmute it's components to something els.
Things most easily transition from doing what they are now to being trash, not from doing their current function
to some other, newer function, even just being scrap parts waiting to have a new task breathed in to them.

## the personhood of computers
when a computer thing is in development you can always ask the technicians "which one is the good child,
and which is the problem child",
and they will point towards a "well behaved" unit and a "bad behaved" unit. even in the most synthetic
possible things - computers are some of the most highly repeatable, synthetic, and understood things
in existance - they still acquire their own personalities and souls in the eyes of those who use them.

programmers talk about "what the computer does" or "what it wants to do" as a natural metaphore, even
for the simplest of algorithms.

## reduction of humans to components
This also parallels and dovetails w/ some crap I've found to be the case w/ many engineering companies.
they passivly concieve of their stuff as being things, and regularly try to reduce the people involved to
also being things. this feels like the root of the alienation of processes and procedures. not that they
are frustrating or difficult but that they are designed with the goal of reducing those following them to
things, to parts, rather than as a kind and helpful interaction. a good procedure or is itself a tool,
an idea built with the goal of helping it's users to fulfil their own goals, to do work for them.

the [Spaulding classification system][], and related sanitization and sterilization frameworks, are
 tools built to make it easy for healthcare proffesionals
 to provide quality care and avoid infecting people easily. the extremely complicated world of
microbiology and human imune system and its interactions with an ever expanding sequence of tools, materials,
and other things is reduced to easy rules. this isn't "dumbing it down" or "making it idiot proof", it's
doing work *for* those providers so they don't have to read 20 journal articles on infection control in the
thick of helping a patient just to make sure they don't give them a bloodbourne illness.

### grumbling about things being made for grunts vs doctors here?
nobody talks about making a medical test easy to perform by medical profesionals as "idiot proofing", because
doctors and nurses aren't idiots.

# the spirituality of simple rule and emergent systems
talk about the tales around eliza, and people's reactions to it. when you try to reduce complicated things
to simple rulesets it doesn't have to be in an attempt to squeeze the magic out - but to learn where 
the magic actually is. eliza, and many compture language systems, can produce startling facimiles of
human language, gramatical
